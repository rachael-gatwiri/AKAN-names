        <h1>The Akan Culture</h1>
        <p><em>Embracing the Ghanian culture</em></p>
        <p>The Akan are a meta-ethnicity predominantly speaking Central Tano languages and
          residing in the southern regions of the former Gold Coast region in what is today
          the nation of Ghana. Akans who historically migrated from Ghana also make up a 
          plurality of the populace in the Ivory Coast. The Akan language (also known as Twi/Fante)
          is a group of dialects within the Central Tano branch of the Potou–Tano subfamily 
          of the Niger–Congo family.
     </p>
     <p>Akan conflicts led to a high number of military captives being sold into slavery
      known as "Coromantee". These Coromantee soldiers and other Akan captives were 
      notorious for a large number of slave revolts and plantation resistance tactics. 
      These captives were feared throughout the Americas so much so that we can see their
      legacy within groups such as the Maroons of the Caribbean and South America.
   </p>
   <p>Akan culture can also be found in the New World.A number of Akans were taken as
    captives to the Americas. Roughly ten-percent of all slave ships embarked from the
    Gold Coast. The primary source of wealth within Akan economy was gold. However as 
    wars culminate in the region the capture and sale of Akan people peaked during 
    the Fante and Ashanti conflicts (as both sides sold a large number of their captives)
    as prisoners of war.
